# Lab 1 - 5-bit DAC

## Schematic
-The design of a 5-bit DAC using an n-well R of 10k
  - Implement 2R resistor with two 10k resistors
- How to determine the output resistance of the DAC?
## Delay, driving a load
- Ground all DAC inputs except B4. Connect B4 to a pulse source and show, and predict using 0.7RC, the delay the DAC has driving a 10 pF load
- Verify that simulation results match hand calculations
##Simulations to verify your design functions correctly
- Apply different input values and verify that the output is correct.
- What happens if the DAC drives a 10k load?

##Layout
- how to select width and legnth of the resistor?
